# ⏱️ Emergent Cache Timer

**Save 60-80% on Emergent credits using the 5-minute cache rule.**

👉 **[Use the tool here](https://ikerbuenor.github.io/emergent-cache-timer/)**

---

## What is this?

A simple timer that helps you maximize cache hits when building with [Emergent.sh](https://emergent.sh). 

When you send code or context to Emergent, it stays cached for approximately 5 minutes. Any follow-up tasks within that window cost significantly fewer credits. This tool helps you track that window and batch your tasks efficiently.

## How it works

1. **Prepare 3-5 related tasks** before starting
2. **Click "I Sent Context"** when you send code/context to Emergent
3. **Complete your tasks** while the cache is hot
4. **When timer expires:** Push to GitHub, start a fresh chat, import your repo

## Features

- ⏱️ Visual countdown with progress bar
- 🎨 Color changes: Green → Yellow (2min) → Red (1min)
- 🔔 Audio alerts at 4m, 3m, 2m, 1m, 30s, 10s
- 📱 Browser notifications (optional)
- 📝 Task list to batch your work
- 💾 Saves state if you refresh the page

## The Strategy

**Without the timer:**
- Send context → Task 1 (full cost)
- 6 minutes later → Task 2 (full cost again, cache expired)
- You paid twice for the same context

**With the timer:**
- Send context → Task 1, Task 2, Task 3 (all within 5 min)
- Cache hits on tasks 2 and 3
- **60-80% savings**
